The University of Washington's Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO) was dedicated by the Department of Astronomy in 1972. It is sited under the dry and dark skies of the eastern slopes of the Cascades, and is not typically open to the public, in part due to its remote location. The observatory was originally used for research, but now hosts students for training and outreach.

MRO houses a [30" Boller and Chivens telescope](https://bollerandchivens.com/?p=1105) under its [Ash Dome](http://www.ashdome.com/). A kitchen and bunks allow groups to comfortably stay for multi-night observing runs. Their photos and videos are available in the [MRO photo album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qF1D4G1Ctw6QgSDG9), and you can hear their stories thanks to KNKX: [Manastash Ridge Observatory teaches UW students about space â€” and themselves](https://www.knkx.org/post/manastash-ridge-observatory-teaches-uw-students-about-space-and-themselves).

Data and images from the observatory's weather station and webcams are available on [the Weather page](../weather/).

MRO was built at the initiative of George Wallerstein, the first chair of the UW Department of Astronomy. Construction was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, as well as by funds from the State of Washington. Central Washington University generously supports a microwave link that provides internet access. We also partner with the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and Earthscope Consortium. The facility and instrumentation is supported and continuously upgraded by the UW's Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group, whose work helps ensure MRO is productive for years to come.
