Our telescope is driven in RA and Dec by a [Sidereal Technology](https://siderealtechnology.com/) F1 Controller, the user interface of which is SciTech.exe. This software runs on the Windows computer in the dome, which we access by remote desktop from the right-hand computer in the control room. Many operations are performed in the SkyView window. Focus is controlled from the [Camera Control](../camera) webpage. The steps to initialize and operate the telescope are described in [the Checklist](../checklist/). 

Notes on SiTech.exe: 
- Scope tab displays paddle speed in the `Mode` box (SLEW, PAN, or GUIDE)
- Numbers tab displays LST, as well as altitude and azimuth
- Goto Sync tab allows the entry of an arbitrary RA & Dec, be sure to click the J2000 checkbox as appropriate.

Notes on SkyView: 
- Zoom1 zooms back out
- right click allows you to move to any arbitrary ("random") area
